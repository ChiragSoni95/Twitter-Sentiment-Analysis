# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
**Problem Statement:** 

>Given a collection of tweets, the program classify them into four classes namely:
- Positive
- Negative
- Neutral
- Mixed

**Dataset Information:**

>The tweets used here are pertaining to two US presidential candidates namely: Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. By classifying the tweets into the mentioned classes we would be capable of predicting the opinion of the public and get a sense of the outcome of the election.

**Classification Methods:**
A. MultinomialNaiveBayesClassifier
B. Support Vector Machines(SVM) with RBF/Gaussian Kernel
C. Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD)
D. LogisticRegression
E. Ensemble Methods:
- Random Forest
- Bagging
- Boosting(XG-Boost)
- Voting using SVM with Gaussian kernel, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Stochastic Gradient Descent.
- Neural Network: Convolutional Neural Network
